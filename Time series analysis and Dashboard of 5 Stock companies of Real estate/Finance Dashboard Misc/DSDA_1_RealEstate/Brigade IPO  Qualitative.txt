Bangalore-based real estate developer Brigade Enterprises (BEL) is offering 16 million shares in the primary market with a face value of Rs 10 each. Post-issue, promoter holding in the company will reduce to around 58%. The IPO proceeds will be used to fund land acquisition and for development and construction of existing properties.Started in 1990, BEL has been developing properties mainly in and around Bangalore, Mysore and Mangalore. So far, it has developed 5.67 million sq ft of saleable area through residential, commercial and hospitality projects. BEL holds land reserves of 403.45 acres, which will translate into 44.16 million sq ft of development rights. It expects to develop 23.14 million sq ft of saleable area in the next 3-5 years. Out of this, integrated lifestyle enclaves account for 47%, residential properties 27%, commercial properties 22%, and hospitality projects account for the remaining share of forthcoming projects. Of these 28 projects, approximately 12.53 million sq ft is already under construction and Bangalore accounts for nearly 75% of these projects.

During the past three years, the company’s revenue has witnessed a CAGR of 61%, while its net profit has increased by 90%. The company continued to show impressive growth in FY07. Income from sales of residential and commercial property comprised a major part of its revenue, while the share of hospitality business and rental income was marginal. BEL reported 200 basis points improvement in EBITDA margins. Post-issue, the debt-to-equity ratio will decline to less than 1:1. 
On annualised HY08 earnings, BEL has a P/E multiple (without considering the greenshoe option) of 44 at the higher end of the price band. Other South-based realty companies, including Sobha Developers and Puravankara Projects, are trading at P/Es of 32 and 107, respectively.

At the higher end of the price band, the company values its development rights at an average price of Rs 1,209/sq ft. Considering the current cost of construction and development and last year’s average realisation rate of Rs 4,000/sq ft, the valuation appears reasonable. BEL’s business model differs from that of its peers, as it does not amass huge land banks; instead, it believes in delivering first and then acquiring further land. Also, its execution and delivery skills appear to be scalable. Revenue from its hospitality business will start flowing in from FY10. Given these factors, investors can consider subscribing to the issue.
