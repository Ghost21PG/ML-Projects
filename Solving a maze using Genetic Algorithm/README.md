# Maze solving using genetic algorithm

## Hello!
## This program creates random mazes and then solves them using a genetic algorithm.
## It uses pygame to create a nice ui, so we can see the mazes being solved in real time.

## A lot of the pygame maze related code was adapted from this tutorial - https://pythonspot.com/maze-in-pygame/ and from the blog -www.justintopfer.com
